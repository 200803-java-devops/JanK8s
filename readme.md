# Initiative:
 - As a developer, when I push my code to the master branch, I want my changes to be integrated onto a build/artifacts repository and pushed to/updated on a production server so that I do not have to do those steps myself.

## Epics:
 - CI: As a developer, when I push my code to the master branch, I want my changes to be built, tested, and integrated onto a build/artifacts repository so that integration occurs automatically.
 - As a developer, when I push my code to the master branch, I want my code to be built and pushed to an artifact/build repository so that I do not have to do it myself.
 - As a developer, when a build fails, I want to be notified why the build failed so that I can debug my code more easily.
As a developer, when my code is built, I would like my code to be tested so that   
 - I know the code is functional.
As a developer, when my code fails a test, I want to know what test it failed, and why, so that I can debug my code more easily.

## CD: As a developer, when I push my code to the master branch, I want my changes to appear on a production server, so that I do not have to manually deploy new builds.
 - As a developer, when code pushed to the master branch is built and tested, I want the projects to be packaged and placed on the production server so that it is continuously and automatically deployed.
 - As an operator, when a current build is unsatisfactory, I want to be able to roll back to an earlier build, so that I can make sure that the application is always running smoothly.
 - As an application user, when I use the application, I want it to always be available so that I can use it whenever I want.


## Communication: As a developer I want to be notified of the results of the Pipeline process sent to me so that I can easily access the results and know the status of my latest builds
